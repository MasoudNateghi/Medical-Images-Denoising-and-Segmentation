# Medical-Images-Denoising-and-Segmentation
In this repository, some of the most recent techniques were implemented to denoise and segment medical images through some coursework.. 
## HWs
+ HW1 (Image Filtering)
  + histogram equalization
  + Gaussian/S&P/Mixed Noise and Filtering using different kernels
  + Edge detection
  + Phase and Domain in image 2D DFT
  + PCA for image dataset compression

+ HW2 (Morphological Image Processing and Denosing)
  + Morphological image processing / erosion / dilation
  + GLCM / entropy / homogeneity
  + Compression using DWT / DFT
  + Haar wavelet

+ HW3 (Filtering)
  + Classical Regression Filtering / Bilateral Filtering / Non Local Means / BM3D
  + Diffusion Filtering and edge preserving index calculation
  + Total Variation L1 regularization on noisy phantom

+ HW4 (Segmentation)
  + FCM on MRI
  + FCM+Kmeans
  + GMM
  + partial volume
  + GVF
  + basic snake
  + chan-vese

+ HW5 (Segmentation)
  + Intensity Inhomogeneity
  + BiasCorrected Fuzzy C-Means(BCFCM)
  + Deformable Modeling 
    + Gradient Vector Flow
    + Snake Models
